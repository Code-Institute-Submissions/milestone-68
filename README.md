# Project Summary

Welcome to my Data Centric Milestone Project for Code Institute.<br>

The Goal of my project is to build a guide for cheese and wine lovers, who aren't sure where to start with choosing a wine for a cheese or vice versa. I wanted the site to be easy to navigate through, by having both the cheese and wine pairing on the same page. <br>

Any guest of the site can view the pairings, only a registered user can upload,edit and delete there own pairings.
